					<h2>Intro</h2>
					<p>The Sense-Maker Workshop will be a private pop-up coworking and meetup space designed especially for sense makers, intellectual explorers, knowledge workers and anyone interested in discussion and philosophy.</p>
					<p>Firstly, the Workshop will be a <em>co-working space</em> for anyone with a laptop to use for working. The vibe will be cosy, comfortable and conducive to thinking. There will be wifi and no music, but we will encourage bringing headphones because people might be talking.</p>
					<p>Secondly, the Workshop will be a <em>meeting place for discussion</em> and philosophical exploration. There will be sofas and chairs and a daily timetable of lightly facilitated discussions. In addition,  pre-existing discussion groups that already meet elsewhere around London will be invited to use the Workshop as a venue.</p>
					<p>Finally, it will be a <em>focal point for meeting visiting thinkers</em>, who we&#8217;ve probably only seen on the internet, in real life. There will be a formal event towards the end of the pop-up timeframe with an interesting internet philosopher, as well as visiting thinkers to have more informal &#8220;open office hours&#8221; at the space so that members can meet them and start discussions. </p>

					<h2>Coworking</h2>
					
					<p>The decor and vibe of the space will be a cross between a private members club, such as the fictional Diogenes club from Sherlock Holmes stories and the run down Paper Street house in Fight Club.</p>
					<img src="img/vibe.png" alt="vibe" width="1024" height="795" style="margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 10px;">
					<p>The space will be private and members only, but not be stuffy. It will by necessity have a rough-and-ready, down-in-the-trenches feel, because currently it&#8217;s a temporary space, but the facilities and furniture will be comfortable, intimate and cosy.</p>
					<p>Membership allows access to the space at any time during opening hours, for as long as you want, as often as you want, with no pressure to leave and no noisy coffee machines! Membership also includes a free ticket to our headline speaker event.</p>
					<p>Daily access tickets will also be available, giving entry for coworking, discussions or just hanging out for one day only. Day tickets do not give access to the headline event, which will have separate tickets.</p>
					<h3>Facilities</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Plug sockets, wifi &amp; printer.</li>
						<li>No food or drink provided, but members are actively encouraged to bring in their own food and drink from outside. There will be coffee nearby.</li>

					<h2>Meeting</h2>
					<p>We believe it&#8217;s vitally important for thinkers to meet each other in real life. The space will be a meeting place on several levels.</p>
					<p>Members who are in the space will be able to meet each other. Informal and formal mechanisms will be used to encourage this such as daily facilitiated discussion. It will be a place where you can come down at any time and find someone interesting to talk to.</p>
					<p>Members will also be able to use the space as a venue for their already existing meetups, discussion groups or strategy sessions. The Workshop will help promote the group, and vice versa. (Attendees of a pre-registered group will not be required to buy full membership just to attend, though a contribution towards the daily entry fee would be appreciated.)</p>

					<h2>Visitors</h2>
					<p>Members will also get the chance to meet thinkers from around the world, who will be specially invited to operate &#8220;office hours&#8221; in the space and to speak at an event at the end of the week. More than one thinker may be present during the week of the pop-up.</p>
					<p>Thinkers will most likely be drawn from intellectual movements currently happening on Twitter, such as rationalists, sensemakers and the various meta-folks, but membership of a particular tribe is not required.</p>
					<p>Purchase of the week-long membership will automatically include a ticket to these events.</p>

					<h2>Pricing</h2>
					<p>There are two types of tickets, membership and day ticket.</p>
					<p>Membership gives full 7 day access to the space for co-working, discussion and any "office hours" visiting philosophers. It also includes a free ticket to our headline event with an internet philosopher  on Thursday / Friday night. This event is TBC. Membership price is Â£25.</p>
					<p>Day tickets give a 1-day access to the space for co-working, discussion and any "office hours" visiting philosophers on the day of your choice. It does not include entry to our headline event, this will have to be purchased separately nearer the time. Day tickets are Â£10.</p>

				<h2>Funding</h2>
					<p>This is a new venture and will be funded by memberships, daily access tickets and event ticket sales. <em>We need around 50 people to pre-order their memberships before we can go ahead</em>. If we fail to reach this number all members will receive a full refund. If we reach this number then everything described above will be provided.</p>
					<p>In addition, the more people who sign up, the more we can provide with the space. For example, more or better furniture, a bigger space, longer opening hours, more facilities or more speakers.</p>
					<p>The funds collected from memberships pay for our three main costs: Rent & utilities, furniture and staffing. All staff and guest philosophers will be paid for their time.</p>
					<p>If this popup goes well it is our goal to set up more versions later in 2020, particularly in May 2020, when we hope to have special guests from the US & Canada. Finally, we hope to one day create a permanent space open year-round.</p>
