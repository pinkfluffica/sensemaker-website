					<h2>Intro</h2>
					<p>The Sense-Maker Workshop is a <em>private meetup space</em> designed especially for thinkers, sense makers, intellectual explorers and anyone interested in discussion, the meaning of life, or trying to make sense of the world. You do not have to be a 'philosopher' to attend, just someone who takes an interest in discussing ideas. </p>
					<img src="img/promo.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
					<p>The Workshop is a <em>meeting place for discussion</em> and thoughtful exploration. There will be sofas and chairs and the staff will introduce people to each other. There will be gentle mechanisms in place, such as a daily discussion topic, to encourage members to talk to each other.</p>
					<p>It's not mandatory to always be talking, though! As a private members-only space, members are welcome to <em>use the venue as a place to read, work, take lunch or have a coffee</em> anytime during opening hours.</p>
					<p><b>For a more detailed description of the vibe</b> and inspiration for the space see this blog post on <a href="http://theoryengine.org/solutions/the-sensemaker-workshop/">Theory Engine</a>.</p>

					<h2>Facilities</h2>
					<p>The space will be arranged like a cafe/lounge. Think books, wing back chairs, sofas, and coffee tables.</p>
					<p>We will not be providing food or drink, but members are actively encouraged to bring in their own food and drink from outside.</p>
					<h3>Other Facilities</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Plug sockets, wifi &amp; printer.</li>
						<li>Toilet</li>
						<li>Smoking area</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Vibe</h3>
					<p>The decor and vibe of the space will be a cross between a private members club, such as the fictional Diogenes club from Sherlock Holmes and the run down Paper Street house in Fight Club.</p>
					<p>The Workshop is currently a temporary space, so by necessity will have a rough-and-ready feel, but the facilities and furniture will be comfortable, intimate and cosy.</p>

					<h2>Meeting</h2>
					<p>We believe it&#8217;s vitally important for thinkers to meet each other in real life. The space will be a meeting place on several levels.</p>
					<p>Members who are in the space will be able to meet each other. Informal and formal mechanisms will be used to encourage this such as daily facilitiated discussion. It will be a place where you can come down at any time and find someone interesting to talk to.</p>
					<p>Members will also be able to use the space as a venue for their already existing meetups, discussion groups or strategy sessions. The Workshop will help promote the group, and vice versa. (Attendees of a pre-registered group will not be required to buy full membership just to attend, though a contribution towards the daily entry fee would be appreciated.)</p>

<!-- 		<div class="section">

				<div class="text-wrapper">
					<h2>Visitors</h2>
					<p>Members will also get the chance to meet thinkers from around the world, who will be specially invited to operate &#8220;office hours&#8221; in the space and to speak at an event at the end of the week. More than one thinker may be present during the week of the pop-up.</p>
					<p>Thinkers will most likely be drawn from intellectual movements currently happening on Twitter, such as rationalists, sensemakers and the various meta-folks, but membership of a particular tribe is not required.</p>
					<p>Purchase of the week-long membership will automatically include a ticket to these events.</p>

				<h2>Funding</h2>
					<p>The funds collected from memberships pay for our three main costs: Rent & utilities, furniture and staffing. All staff and guest philosophers will be paid for their time.</p>
					<p><b>We need 100 memberships to break even</b>. Currently we have sold: <b>33</b> memberships.</p>
					<p>If this popup goes well it is our goal to set up more versions later in 2020, particularly in May 2020, when we hope to have special guests from the US & Canada. Finally, we hope to one day create a permanent space open year-round.</p>
