				<h1>Resident Thinker</h1>
				<h2>Intro</h2>
				<p>If you're reading this page you've been invited to be a 'thinker in residence' at first ever Sense-Maker Workshop, thank you for considering the offer!</p>
				<p>If you need more information about what the Workshop is, please go read the <a href="index.html">main page</a>.</p>
				<h2>What do I have to do?</h2>
				<p>A resident thinker needs to choose a half-day / evening / 4 hour timeslot to sit in a comfy chair at the Workshop. There will be some kind of sign to say who you are. The organiser of the Workshop will be with you and the two of you will wait in the space to see if anyone attends and wants to talk with you. If no-one comes you are free to work on your own projects/laptop/read/whatever. If lots of people come the organiser will help to field questions and moderate discussion.</p>
				<p>The idea is to have low-key, comfortable discussion rather than scripted or overly prepared material, but the organisers are open to most things to make you feel comfortable.</p>
				<p>If you provisionally agree to be a resident thinker we will publicise your name and blog name and twitter name on the timetable on our website, and if you wouldn't mind tweeting that you'll be there to your followers that will help us very much.</p>
				<h2>Benefits</h2>
				<p>Hopefully you'll enjoy the chatting in and of iteself! Meeting Twitter friends in real life can be extremely rewarding. We also anticipate more visits to your blog and more followers on Twitter.</p>
				<p>You will have free access to the Workshop & the main event. Also we will pay you a fee, but the precise amount will depend on ticket sales.</p>
				<h2>Drawbacks</h2>
				<p>People from the internet will know what you look and sound like. If you're account is mostly not anonymous, this should involve little change. However anonymous accounts may find this a more significant barrier.</p>
				<p>You might be bored.</p>
				<h2>Extras</h2>
				<p>If you would like to get involved in another way, for example as a staff member, or be considered for the 'main event' of a panel discussion with two others, which is a separate, ticketed evening event, please let us know!</p>
